            <h3>1.0 Overview</h3>
            <p>
              Nawa Sons Dairy Farm seeks to modernize operations through a centralized digital platform
              that unifies milk collection, storage, sales, and customer engagement. Manual notebooks
              and handwritten receipts have sustained the farm for years, yet they fall short in today’s
              data-driven agricultural landscape. The documentation adopts a sequential structure—
              literature review, methodology, analysis, design, and implementation—to capture the full
              lifecycle from problem discovery to deployment.
            </p>
            <p>
              The introductory chapter provides the background, problem statement, objectives,
              significance, scope, and limitations. These components speak directly to managers,
              employees, and stakeholders who rely on accurate records, efficient workflows, and modern
              customer service to remain competitive.

            <h3>1.1 Background Information</h3>
            <p>
              Nawa Sons is a family-owned farm that prides itself on delivering fresh milk. Quality,
              timeliness, and efficiency are non-negotiable, yet the team depends on manual production
              and sales processes. Milk quantities are logged in notebooks, sales get handwritten
              receipts, payments are cash-based, and reconciliations occur manually—creating gaps between
              recorded sales and actual cash, and obscuring accountability.
            </p>
            <p>
              Inventory checks rely on estimates, causing shortages or wastage, while supplier
              coordination depends on phone calls and rough projections. Customer engagement lacks a
              structured system for loyalty or purchase histories, and promotions are difficult to
              evaluate. As industry peers adopt computerized solutions for production monitoring,
              inventory control, and sales management, Nawa Sons must digitize to stay competitive. The
              proposed system digitizes production data, automates inventory, streamlines sales, and
              embeds customer relationship management to deliver accurate, real-time insight.

            <h3>1.2 Statement of the Problem</h3>
            <p>
              Manual record-keeping introduces reconciliation errors between production, stock, and
              revenue. Inventory checks lack consistency and miss restocking cues, disrupting service
              delivery. Financial accuracy suffers from manual calculations, and management cannot
              generate timely reports or analyze customer behaviour, limiting loyalty initiatives and
              marketing strategies. These inefficiencies reduce profitability and compromise customer
              satisfaction. The proposed information system automates production tracking, inventory
              monitoring, sales processing, and embeds analytics for data-driven decisions.

            <h3>1.4 Significance and Relevance</h3>
            <p>
              Automating previously manual processes reduces errors, saves time, and enhances the
              customer experience. Accurate reporting and real-time data empower managers to forecast
              demand, plan production, optimize inventory, and strengthen financial accountability. The
              project mirrors broader agricultural technology trends, offering tangible benefits to
              owners, employees, and customers alike.

            <h3>1.6 Limitations</h3>
            <p>
              Key challenges include upfront hardware/software costs, the need for reliable internet for
              cloud-enabled features, and staff training commitments. Change management is critical to
              overcome resistance from teams accustomed to manual workflows. External factors—seasonal
              milk supply fluctuations, for example—remain outside the system’s control, but the long-term
              gains in efficiency and competitiveness outweigh these constraints.
